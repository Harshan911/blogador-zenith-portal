title: Getting Started with React
excerpt: Learn the basics of React and start building modern web applications.
content: >-
  React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's declarative, efficient, and flexible.

  Created by Facebook, React has become one of the most popular front-end libraries in the world. It allows developers to create reusable UI components that update efficiently when data changes.

  React uses a virtual DOM to optimize rendering performance. When the state of your application changes, React first updates a virtual representation of the DOM, compares it with the previous version, and then makes the minimum set of changes required to update the actual DOM.

  To get started with React, you'll need to understand JSX, components, props, and state. JSX is a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript. Components are the building blocks of React applications. Props allow you to pass data from parent to child components, and state lets you manage data that changes over time.
